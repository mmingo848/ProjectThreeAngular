This Angular project incorporated the following concepts:
  Modules/Components,
  Cryptography,
  End-to-end encryption,
  Databinding,
  Services,
  Routes/Observables,
  Pipes,
  HTTP Requests.
 I can further expand this project by integration connection to a NoSQL/SQL database. This provides an additional layer of user interaction and dynamic updating within the Angular components.
